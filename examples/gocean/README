These scripts and this version of PSyclone work with version 1.0 of GOcean.

In order to use PSyclone you must first add it to your PYTHONPATH. The
easiest way to do this is to change to the top-level directory of your
PSyclone installation and do:
::
    export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/src:`pwd`/f2py_93:${PYTHONPATH}

PSyclone can be run in the directory containing this file by 
executing, e.g.
::
    python ./runme.py

Examine the runme*.py scripts themselves for further details.
