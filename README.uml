# To make pyreverse provide a reasonably complete UML diagram we need to add
# in fake declarations where it does not realise there is a "has a"
# relationship. We simply qualify these with if False so they never get called.

# All fake declarations have a comment "# for pyreverse"
# The two cases that require fake declarations are
# 1: when a class creates a list of other classes,
# 2: when class names are passed by argument.

# for the dynamo 0.1 api:
pyreverse -A -p dynamo0p1 dynamo0p1.py # -A includes base classes
dotty classes_dynamo0p1.dot # to view
dot -Tsvg classes_dynamo0p1.dot > classes_dynamo0p1.svg # to generate svg

# for gocean
pyreverse -A -p gocean gocean.py
dotty classes_gocean.dot
dot -Tsvg classes_gocean.dot > classes_gocean.svg

# svg can be imported into libreoffice, although there appears to be a bug with visualisation
# (it looks OK in eog)

# below might make it prettier?
