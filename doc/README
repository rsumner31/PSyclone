Generating Documentation
========================

PSyclone must be installed (see the top-level README.md file) before
attempting to generate the documentation. This is because installation
creates a 'psyclone.version' module which is used during creation of
the documentation.

The documentation for PSyclone is created by
Sphinx (http://sphinx-doc.org). Documentation can be created in a
number of formats, such as html, latex and pdf. To see the options
"cd" to the "doc" directory and type "make" if on a linux system or
run the "make.bat" script if on a windows system. If you want the API
section of the documentation to be present then you will need to make
sure that the python code in this directory is accessible from your
PYTHONPATH. In linux, once in the "doc" directory you can simply add:
export PYTHONPATH=../src:${PYTHONPATH}
Note, on my desktop I need to type make twice to remove any generation
errors.

Sphinx
======

Sphinx is required to create the documentation. It is written in
Python and can be installed from here
(http://sphinx-doc.org/install.html).  Installation instructions are
here (http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/install.html).  To install on a
debian/ubuntu distribution run "sudo apt-get install python-sphinx".
To install using easy_install, download the appropriate egg and run
"easy_install my_egg.egg". Eggs for Sphinx 1.1.3 can be found here
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx/1.1.3.  This project is currently
using version 1.1.3. Earlier versions of Sphinx may not work (version
0.6.4 fails for example) so may need to be updated. One way to update
earlier versions of Sphinx is to follow the easy_install instructions
as the installation overwrites the previous version.
