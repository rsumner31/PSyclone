Introduction
============

Welcome to PSyclone. PSyclone is a code generation system that generates
appropriate code for the PSyKAl code structure developed in the GungHo project.

Please see psyclone.pdf in this directory for more information. If you would
prefer to build the documentation, please see the README file in the "doc"
directory.

There is a simple installer (contributions/install) which creates a
stand-alone tree containing the functional components. To make use of the
result add the python package directories to PYTHONPATH and consider adding
the "bin" directory to PATH.
