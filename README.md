# Introduction #

Welcome to PSyclone. PSyclone is a code generation system that generates
appropriate code for the PSyKAl code structure developed in the GungHo project.

Please see psyclone.pdf in this directory for more information. If you would
prefer to build the documentation, please see the README file in the "doc"
directory.

# Installation #

If you are reading this then you have presumably not already installed
PSyclone from the Python Package Index (https://pypi.python.org/pypi).
That being so, you can install this copy of PSyclone by doing:

    $ python setup.py install

or, if you do not have root access:

    $ python setup.py install --prefix /my/install/path

Alternatively, if you have pip:

    $ pip install .

For a user-local installation simply add the --user flag:

    $ pip install --user .

This installs the PSyclone modules in
~/.local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages (where X.Y is the version of
Python that you are using) and the 'psyclone' script in
~/.local/bin. Depending on your linux distribution, you may need to
add the latter location to your PATH.
